# Introduction to Computer Vision for Pedestrian Tracking
Apart from existing applications of computer vision including robotics, surveillance and automotive safety, pedestrian detection remains one of the major challenges in the field. It is formulated as the problem of automatically identifying and locating the pedestrians in images or videos. In the past, many techniques have been proposed to solve this problem accurately and efficiently. However, the variations in images such as body attire and pose, occlusion, different illumination parameters in different scenarios and clutter present in the background poses challenges in attaining high accuracy. An increasing number of challenging public datasets has driven much of the progress of pedestrian tracking few years back. To continue the rapid rate of innovation, this project aims to improve the overall performance of the existing methods by combining the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Haar-like features with particle filtering.
